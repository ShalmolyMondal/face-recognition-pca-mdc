# Face Recognition Using PCA and Minimum Distance Classification

## Abstract
Face recognition technology encounters significant challenges due to variations in facial expressions, poses, and illumination conditions, which are easily discernible by humans but difficult for machines. This paper introduces a robust combination of feature extraction technique and classifier, aiming to achieve high accuracy in face recognition across multiple standard databases. Utilizing principle component analysis (PCA) for feature extraction and minimum distance classification for classification, this approach is tested on the ORL and YALE datasets. It demonstrates impressive accuracy rates of 95.63% and 93.33%, respectively, despite variations in facial expressions, poses, and illumination.

## Introduction
Face is a paramount characteristic for identifying individuals, yet its varying expressions present a significant hurdle for machine recognition. The intricacies of facial recognition encompass both feature extraction and classification, where the optimal combination is crucial for maximum accuracy. 

## Methodology
This study focuses on a unique combination of principle component analysis (PCA) for extracting facial features, subsequently classified using a minimum distance classification system. This methodology is crafted to handle the complexities introduced by varied facial expressions, poses, and lighting conditions efficiently.

### Feature Extraction
- **PCA (Principle Component Analysis):** Utilized for the robust extraction of facial features, serving as the foundational step of the recognition process.

### Classification
- **Minimum Distance Classification:** These extracted features are classified, focusing on achieving high accuracy with minimal computational complexity.

## Results
Our proposed method was rigorously tested on two renowned face datasets:
- **ORL Dataset:** Achieved an accuracy rate of 95.63%.
- **YALE Dataset:** Recorded an accuracy rate of 93.33%.

These results underscore the effectiveness of our proposed combination, particularly in handling diverse facial expressions and challenging conditions.

## Conclusion
The research validates the efficiency of combining PCA with minimum distance classification for face recognition, proving to be a formidable approach across different datasets. This method stands as a testament to achieving high accuracy in face recognition, navigating the common obstacles posed by variable facial expressions, poses, and illumination conditions.
